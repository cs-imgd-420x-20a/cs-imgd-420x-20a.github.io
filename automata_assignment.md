# Mini-Assignment (in-class, due Monday 2/10/20)

The goal of this assignment is to gain experience manipulating simulations on the GPU. Choose two of the following extensions to the game of life and implement them. Place the resulting simulation on your website for the class. This assignment will count for a small portion of your participation grade for the course (~2% of your final grade).

- Right now our simulation is bounded... how to make it torroidal?  
- The resolution of our simulation is pretty high, which is cool, but also makes it hard to tell what's happening. How can we decrease the resolution, and slow the simulation down?  
- How can we define more interesting initial conditions than pure randomness?  
- What if we have more than two possible states?  
- What tricks could we use to make this more visually interesting?
