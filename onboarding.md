# Assignment 1 - Onboarding

This assignment counts towards the quizzes / in-class assignments portion of your grade.

1. First, check your email for an invite to the class Slack workspace. *All course announcements will be via Slack*. You must sign up ASAP for this workspace and check it regularly; in addition it will hopefully be a great place to ask questions and receive help. All questions regarding class content should be publicly asked in Slack whenever possible so that your classmates can a) potentially answer b) learn from any provided answer.

2. Create a public website for all work completed in the course. The homepage for this website can be extremely minimal (potentially just a list of links); however, each assignment will generally require you to provide both text and video documentation of your work. Anybody should be able to visit your course website and quickly find this information. Once you have a URL for this website, please make a pull request on the main course website repo adding your link to the websites.md file.

3. Read / experiment with [the Book of Shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com) up through the lesson on [Shapes](https://thebookofshaders.com/07/), with the exception of the chapter "Running Your Shader" (feel free to read this if you like, but we won't be discussing the material in this chapter until next week, and even then only part of it). This will ensure that you have the necessary background for class on 1/16.  

4. All of the above are due by the start of class on 1/16. There may be a brief quiz about the assigned reading.
